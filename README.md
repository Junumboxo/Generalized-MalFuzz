# Generalized-MalFuzz

This is a repository for a project within my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science Engineering at the Budapest University of Tecnology and Economics. The project is developed within CrySyS lab (https://www.crysys.hu/) and proposes an architecture for adversarial example generation for a random forest based IoT malware detector.
